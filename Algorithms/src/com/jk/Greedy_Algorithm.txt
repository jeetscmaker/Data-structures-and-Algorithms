Greedy Algorithm
-------------------
It is an algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving approach of making the local
optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimal.

Pros of Greedy Algorithm:
    It is simple, easy to implement and runs fast.

Cons of Greedy Algorithm:
    It doesn't provide the Global optimal solution very often.

When to use?
------------
Look for these two properties:
    - A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local minimum.
    - An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution
        to the sub-problems.
Applications where we can use G.A.
    - Activity selection problem
    - Huffman Coding
    - Job sequencing problem
    - Fractional Knapsack problem
    - Prim's minimum spanning tree.
