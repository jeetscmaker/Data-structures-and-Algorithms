Graph traversal algorithms are also called graph search algorithms.

DFS(Depth First Search):-
------------------------
In the beginning all the nodes are unvisited. When a node is visited it becomes
a grey node. isVisited is a boolean variable which keeps track of every node.
Stack data structure is used for DFS. In a DFS, we start from a given node 'u'.
Then we traverse  depth of u until we find a 'dead-end'. Dead-end means when there
is no further adjacent node to proceed. At the dead-end, we backtrack to the previous
node, and proceed for its next adjacent node. We continue this operation till the
backtracking takes back to the starting node.
Sometimes an edge leads to an already discovered node, this edge is called a back edge.
When back edges are removed, we get tree edges.

BFS(Breadth First Search):-
---------------------------
Queue data structure is used for BFS purpose. In this approach of graph traversal, we
cover all the nodes at one given level, then we move to another level. It is similar
to level order traversal of trees. the visited nodes are kept in the queue. While processing
a node, we dequeue the node from queue. This process is continued until queue is empty.
