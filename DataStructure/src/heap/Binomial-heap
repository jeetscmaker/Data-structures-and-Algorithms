A binomial heap is implemented as a set of binomial trees (compare with a binary heap,
which has a shape of a single binary tree), which are defined recursively as follows:[1]

    => A binomial tree of order 0 is a single node
    => A binomial tree of order k has a root node whose children are roots of binomial
       trees of orders k − 1, k − 2 , ..., 2, 1, 0 (in this order).
